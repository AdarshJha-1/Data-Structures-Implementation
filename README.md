# Data Structures Implemented from Scratch üöÄ

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures from scratch to gain a deep understanding of how they work internally.

## üìå Why Implement from Scratch?
- To understand the underlying logic and working of each data structure.
- To improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

## üìö Data Structures & Functionalities

### 1. Arrays
- **Insert** (at beginning, middle, end)
- **Delete** (at beginning, middle, end)
- **Search** (Linear Search, Binary Search)
- **Update** (Modify an element)
- **Traverse** (Print all elements)
- **Sort** (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)

### 2. Linked List (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- **Insert** (at head, tail, middle, sorted position)
- **Delete** (head, tail, middle, by value)
- **Search** (by value, by position)
- **Update** (modify a node value)
- **Reverse** (Iterative, Recursive)
- **Traverse** (Forward, Backward for Doubly)

### 3. Stack
- **Push** (Insert element)
- **Pop** (Remove top element)
- **Peek/Top** (Get top element)
- **isEmpty** (Check if stack is empty)
- **isFull** (Check if stack is full)
- **Size** (Get the number of elements)

### 4. Queue (Normal, Circular, Deque, Priority Queue)
- **Enqueue** (Insert at the rear)
- **Dequeue** (Remove from front)
- **Front** (Get front element)
- **Rear** (Get last element)
- **isEmpty** (Check if queue is empty)
- **isFull** (Check if queue is full)
- **Size** (Get number of elements)

### 5. Tree (Binary Tree, BST, AVL, Heap, Trie)
- **Insert** (Into BST, Heapify in Heap)
- **Delete** (Node deletion in BST)
- **Search** (Find a node)
- **Traversal** (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level Order)
- **Height** (Get height of tree)
- **Find Min/Max** (Smallest or largest value in BST)
- **Balance** (For AVL Trees)
- **Merge** (Combine two trees)
- **Successor/Predecessor** (Find next/previous element in BST)

### 6. Graph (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)
- **Add Edge** (Directed, Undirected, Weighted)
- **Remove Edge**
- **Add Vertex**
- **Remove Vertex**
- **Search** (BFS, DFS)
- **Shortest Path** (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, Bellman-Ford)
- **Minimum Spanning Tree** (Prim‚Äôs, Kruskal‚Äôs)
- **Cycle Detection** (Using DFS for directed and undirected graphs)
- **Topological Sorting** (For DAG)
- **Connected Components** (Find all connected components)

## üõ†Ô∏è Language Choice for Implementation

- **C** (Best for absolute deep learning, manual memory management)
